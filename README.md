# Scrape your Youtube Profile
**This is still in development.**



It's a youtube history viewer, with some pretty diagramms basically. 
I'm writing this application to be able to instantly search my youtube history. Also there may be advanced filters in the future, right now it's just a history viewer, with instant search. 
This is all possible thanks to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout), which enables users to export data from their google accounts. 

# How to run
1. Install conda and clone the environment 
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda env activate <name-of-environent>

```
2. Run extracting_data.py using python3.5
```
python3.5 extracting_data.py
```


yt_scraping is planned to include the features
- [x] search instantly
- [x] generate pretty Wordclouds
- [x] automatically and concurrently download the thumbnails
- [ ] advanced text search 
- [ ] approximate string matching [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
- [ ] full text search (based on the subtitles)
- [ ] read the 10mb html hitory file with a little bit of parallelism/multiprocessing




(these are not the selling points, but rather milestones of the development)
