# idea. Json is not really necessary , and just use python dict I think.... This would simplify the code tremendously
# consider: Some objects may have not the expected values. Test this! If it occurs, this incidence should not
# confound the correct chronological order. Just jump to the next one.
#

# Initially: Load the html raw data. Then feed that into python dict. And maybe, parallel, thumbnails download
