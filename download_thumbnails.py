#craete folder in pyhton to store thumbnails. 
# get the id and name the thumbnail after the id ( very good idea)

#idea. Json is not really necessary , and just use python dict I think.... This would simplify the code tremendously
#consider: Some objects may have not the expected values.
# Test this! If it occurs, this incidence should not confound the correct chronological order. Just jump to the next one.
