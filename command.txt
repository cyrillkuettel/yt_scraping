The command that could install for sudo:
 sudo -H python3 -m  pip install --upgrade youtube-dl
 and then sudo python3 getSubtitles.py

But this installs it globally. Which is not what i want
It finally worked:

conda install pip==9.0.3

youtube-dl --skip-download --write-auto-sub --sub-format srt 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgUATs2bx7w'
